The new year day.

Im spending the night in my favorite spot above the bay, on Grzzly Peak rd. Ready to hit
a few rides next morning, before heading to work at the village. Today was amazing. So full of light 
and hope and so packed with actions and events.

Helped out Ashel juicing after skating. I love doing that. Then, came to our planned solar system meeting 
at the village. Someone wants to  make a donation of solar system  gear and wants to discuss
it.  thats all we  know.  Happens to be an org supporting and promoting emergency off grid power 
solutions all over the world. We will have a world-class
practically turn key system  on a free loan, and all the support. They are
hoping this as an opportunity to set up an educational program,  about 
off grid solar systems. Yep, another micro venture opportunity. 
Its adding up. So far, we came up with these ideas.
* a worm farm and an organic garden
making excess of worms and wormcastings available to the public. Of course, organic produce as well, but
we have mouths to feed.
  
* An adobe brick operation
These can be used for our construction projects and be available to public
  
* A music recording studio, or a jam band, or both
We got lots of musicians, cool spot, good vibes, amazing acoustics inside cob houses, a stage, 
  a solid solar system with plenty of  power. This has a tremendous potential.
  The stoke generated can be channeled into donations and provide a source of
  income for the residents
  
* A boutique shop with cob craft. kinda like clay but much simpler, no equipment, just mud

* eventually, we can designate a few cabins for coming apprentices and open an educational program. There will be plenty to 
  teach, plenty of people wanting to learn, some will want to support us paying 
  the fees and some will be donated a tuition.
  
And then, i joined Migz building a composting toilet.  We measured up the area and planned out 
the whole street full  of cabins and gardens and the grand stage at the end of the main street.

But something else happened in parallel. A woman stopped by. Many people just happen to drive by,
get very curious and excited. She was one of  those. She is sister of one
of the residents, with a post in local government. A well-dressed and well-spoken black woman.  So 
happy to see this miracle in this miserable place. She wants to  move in 
and be a caretaker.  I think we just found the first Mayor of cobville.

But, we will not be picking residents of the village by private invitations.  I think each
new resident would have to pitch his/her case to the community,  to take the responsibility,
of stewardship and of being defender of the faith, our culture. 

We're building a community, an oasis of a sane culture. We are building a model to follow.
We hope it'll prove to others, it is possible and it is not hard,  to do the right thing, to 
change the future, for the better, despite all the excuses and obstructions, because love 
crosses any borders, built out of hate.
