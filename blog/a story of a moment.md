Theres no moment, but theres a story, sorry for bate and switch.
This is a story of a day. So,  Ill start the day before. 

Im living out of the car, away from my cozy bus, helping at cob village in afternoons, 
skating in the mornings, coding at night, camping next to my favorite skating hills,
wherever people grant me a smile and a parking spot for a night. And then, 
I decide Iv had enough practice with my new comet board and ready for a real
ride in the magical mountains of Santa Cruise. Called up a few skating cats 
and they agreed with my wisdom. 

But no, its not a story about a pack of skaters getting roudy and having cops 
called in, cos no one showed up. It rained all night onto my bivy sack sleeping 
outside the car. The road is slick as ice,  im scared and Im just an apprentice.
All the pros bailed, for good reason. So, im hiking up by myself, just to check out if
sun still exists up there above the rainy clouds swallowing us out of his sight. You see, 
its the New Year, and everyone has a day off. The sun is sick of us, watching all he creates
being promptly destroyed.

Frankly, I love these hikes up for miles almost more then skating down, with my board so light, the harp so bright, the
world is right, and all the neighbours welcoming me with a smile and a quick chat. Most 
like my harp, not all. But at least, they get a fair warning.

I went as high as my harp wanted to go, lead by its enchanting rhythm, taking my mind off the 
cliffs and gnarly cacti around icy switchbacks. Theres not 100' of straight road anywhere, just
like the rest of my life. I think the name is ADHD. If you got it,  I salut you, bro. 
Dont ever change.

Well, it went well. Right off the start,  someone pulled  up by my soggy camp and handed me a big cup of coffee 
with 'Happy New Year'. Then, on the other side of the cloud, on the tipsy top, im taking
a leak in someone's frontyard, with goats going ape, emy staring at me while pacing behind
the gate,  ready to charge,  and the roosters drowning my harp in crazy racus. Just then, someone 
pulls up in a car.  BUSTED !!!! No, he tells me emy is called Groot and invites me in to film it.
See for  yourself. I parted with 'Guess, Ill just go and crash somewhere near by', and took off into
the fuzzy and rainy future.

And that was the best ride Iv ever skated. Yep, its slick, and I did go off on a tangent , 
off a few tight toe switchbacks. At the bottom of the run I was a different skater. The ride took me into 
the universe of style. Im just a guest in there,  standing in the hallway full of closed doors,
with bright light shining behind each.  The doors are not locked, just to keep light pollution down.

I made it to the cob village to finish a small project our Wizard Of Cob handed to me, and to join
a bango chant jam. The acoustics in those cob huts is amazing. We all climb in with whatever
makes a sound and .... You just have to listen when we start recording soon. 

Today is another day, on top of another hill, in another neighborhood full of smiling people.
Same routine. Gotta go skating, gotta keep building.  We have a meeting with camp residents.
Its very important. If we dont have their buy in, we are wasting our time building community
for them. And I have to code. Im coding up my life, typifying the use case. 
If i like it, so will others,  im not special. Im simply expressing myself in a different lingo,
javaScript, the language of true dreams.
