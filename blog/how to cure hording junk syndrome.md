The piles of junk around curbside communities is a familiar site. No one likes it, inside or outside the encampments.
The reason it happens, besides illegal dumping, is simply the lack of any other resources but the trash and refuse, plenty of that in our society.

So, we are building a beautiful cob village, about to be overrun by ugly junk. At the end of evolution, we simply 
created another ugly camp and proved futility of our own efforts. Well be a laughingstock and donations will dry up.

The patented cure for hording junk is the security, of a self-sufficient community with a few established trades, 
where strong are busy making a living, and the weak are taken care of from the generosity of the community fund.

Establishing those trades, as micro ventures, and teaching residents in those trades is the key. It must happen in 
parallel with our building efforts. Them participating and learning the trade of adobe and cob is an excellent start
in that direction.

We are planning to have a meeting with the residents this coming sunday. I think this meeting should be advertized
as a community business planning meeting.
