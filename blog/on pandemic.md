Let me explain the hype about pandemic.
Yeah, every 1 out 1000 americans dead, since the start. What, about 6mo ago?
You know, people die all the time, at rate of 1.85mil a year, at 80years life expectancy. Just happens, even if every life matters, cos life has an end.
So, 300k people dead due to pandemic is 16% increase in natural attrition.  its really 8% since they already spent half life living.
I'm not belittling these 8%. All I'm saying those that belarge a tiny bump in a natural process are doing us a huge disservice, cos response is way out of proportion and the whole cart gets out of ballance and falls over. Then, many more will lose lifes.
But, let me ask you, how many deaths happened and yet will due to neglect, hardship. Iv seen people dead, from shootings and loneliness, and simply gone mad, and life is getting harder every day for a lot of people. How many commit suiside?
How do you calculate damage from all these restrictions. All waiters are out of work doing what? Prbly dealing drugs, right? How many does that kill. Iv seen deaths from meth, yep.
But, you know why all that does not matter? Cos it's the poor and homeless are dying. That's ok. If any survive, well sendm to war.
Non of this holds any moral water. The king has no cloth, never did.
