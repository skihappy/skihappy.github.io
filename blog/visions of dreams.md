Visions of dreams
To come true
To let us thru

To the other side
Of darkness

We should set up a community fund that pays ongoing bills, but also accumulates hours of work, 
and pays out what's left to the contributors. Then, credits can be donated to the needy and the weak. 
Money would come from community ventures and raised donations. Other local businesses would be 
approached to help out with apprenticeships and guidance for community credits, and we got a trading, 
bartering network with local currency based on time and kindness. Thats the fertile soil to build upon.

This is the vision. How to implement it? Custom coding it is the best. In meantime, we can do what we can 
with the tools we have. Any ideas are highly welcome. Once we have some kinda established record keeping, 
there are web devs available to code it up.

So, heres the ides of micro ventures, so far.
* Establish a worm farm, breeding red worms. Harvest worms and worm castings. Use whatever we need in our organic 
  gardens to grow healthy and plentiful food.  Sell surplus food, worms and worm castings to the public.
  
* Suggested by Migz. An Adobe brick making business and sell the bricks for $3 each...
  Or building cob ovens & benches and deliver them...
