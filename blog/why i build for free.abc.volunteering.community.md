The days I am at the construction site is the happiest I ever been in my l
ife. The synergy of all of us is beyond any poetry. Its the next level. 
We make each other nobble and important, rising on our love for each other 
and for people we are helping. 
Its mind blowing.

* What about money? 

I need some money, true. Its the ballance, a fine line. After I take care of myself,  i
can gift my time to  the community. I have more fun doing that, so  I  minimize my needs.
so i can spend more time with my tribe.
But, the real solution is changing the upside down culture. Its generally accepted that dogooders d
ont get paid, not directly by those they benefit, the local general public. That
is absurd. Community organizers provide value, the one the pros should have instead, yeah the politicians.
I expect that to be changing, for we will manifest that, we will find a way.  Its called our own
local economy, where contributors are the same local businesses donating their time and resources
to aquire social capital.

* What social capital? How do we measure it and how do you cash in on it?

Simple. We keep the records, in our own time records. One hour is the unit of local currency. Yep, we got
our own money and all the responsibility that comes with it. 
Look whos getting rich now.
